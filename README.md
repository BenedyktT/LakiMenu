# LakiMenu
Laki menu single page

One of my first websites using vanilla javascript,
google maps api
netlify cloud form collections for form handle, custom webpack config, that handles .js .css .html .scss files, automatic
compressing of images,
new page elements are react components, design and css is purely original.

npm run start for developing (comment out image resize in package.json to get faster develop experience(
npm run build for production
